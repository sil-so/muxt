**Muxt** was built to solve a specific workflow friction: the constant context-switching required to keep up with curated accounts across platforms.

For developers and creatives who use social media to track resources, news, and design inspiration, Muxt offers a cleaner, more efficient alternative. It unifies your feeds side-by-side, removes visual clutter, and provides tools like synchronized scrolling, dimmable columns and grayscale mode to make checking your feeds faster and less distracting.

## Features

🧩 **Multi-column View** - Monitor X, LinkedIn, Bluesky, Threads, and Reddit simultaneously in a single window.
🎨 **Grayscale Mode** - Optional monochrome filter to reduce visual stimulation and focus purely on information.
🎯 **Focus Mode** - Automatically dims unfocused columns to minimize peripheral distractions while reading.
🛡️ **Ad & Tracker Blocking** - Integrated Ghostery engine for a cleaner, faster, and more private experience.
🔄 **Smart Scroll Sync** - Scroll all feeds in unison. Sync automatically pauses when interacting with a specific post to prevent layout jumps.
🧱 **Customizable Layouts** - Drag-and-drop to reorder, resize columns, or toggle specific platforms on or off. Preferences persist between sessions.
🌐 **Default Browser Support** - External links are opened in your default OS browser.
